# Bedrock+
Bedrock+ is the best legit internal client for Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Win 10/11).

## Setup:
- Get the [Bedrock+ Launcher](https://github.com/BedrockPlus/launcher)
- WAIT! Until Bedrock+ Releases :D

## Features:
- WAIT! Until Bedrock+ Releases :D

## FAQ:
Soon...

## Logos:
We have a logo and many different variations of it, where you can access all [here](https://github.com/BedrockPlus/BedrockPlus/tree/main/logos).

However, by using this logo, you need to follow these rules while using it:
- Do not use it to promote anything outside of Bedrock+ or its brand.
- Do not use it to clickbait users with content not created by us.
- Do not use it under a different name than, "Bedrock+", "B+", or any well-recognized alternative uses.
- Do not sell brand assets.

## Special Thanks:
At Bedrock+ I (notchyves), do not want to take all the credit. Thanks to all of my friends encouraging me and helping me know better ways to improve my code.

- Extremely special thanks to:
  - xStormy (the builder of the [launcher](https://github.com/BedrockPlus/launcher))

I also want to give my thanks to the amazing open source libraries I used, without them this wouldn't be possible.
